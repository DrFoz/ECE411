Project overview

This project encompasses the hardware and software design of a haptic feedback compass
to assist an individual with landbased navigation.
Applications could include hiking, hunting, or as additional aid for the visually impaired.
Direction will be determined with the use of a digital magnometer and microprocessor. 
Mode Select and direction select will be set with the use of a momentary switch mounted to 
the case. Feedback will be generated using micro dc vibrator motor, to indicate mode and
direction selected, as well as to indicate a deviation from desired direction. During 
operation Haptic feedback intensity will be preportional to the deviation of desired 
direction of travel. Device will be powered by a lithium polymer pouch cell that is 
removable and rechargeable via external charger.
